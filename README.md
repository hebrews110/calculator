I made a few changes to the original program. The reasons are down below. I hope upstream can make use of it.

General fixes: 
  1. Fixed spacing in all the files.

Feature fixes: 
  1. Calculator stores the answer, resets, then displays the number after pushing "equals". 
  2. Made the calculator slightly bigger.

Bug fixes:
  1. After "Feature Fix" #1 above, equal sign still appears red after calculation, even if there is only one number.
  2. Even after the calculator resets with the answer after pushing another operator, it has the wrong maximum of so many characters that you can type.
